* A simple example module for ENEXA
** Build
Build the [[https://github.com/EnexaProject/enexa-utils][enexa-utils]] Docker image first, then:
#+begin_src shell :results output silent
make build
#+end_src
That would build a Docker image for this module.

** Test
Setup the test environment from [[https://github.com/EnexaProject/enexa-utils][enexa-utils]] first, then:
#+begin_src shell :results output silent
make test
#+end_src
That would run your module in a dummy environment.
The result files would be stored in ~test-shared-dir~.
The RDF data would be inserted to a locally running SPARQL store.

** Developer information
- ~example~ :: A main application script, possibly unaware of ENEXA.
- ~module~ :: A main module script to translate the input and output parameters between ENEXA and the application.
- ~Dockerfile~ :: A Dockerfile for the Docker image of this module.
